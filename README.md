## 💇 Process 
I was watching a design trends and some websites shown in video were great in UI so I decided to build one of them as it help me learn the new concepts such as how to make the good sleek animations using the framer motions and how and why the reusablity is important in react. First I built the banner which was a text heavy and implemented resusable animation section later on I built the text animation component which was basically a scroll trigger text animation later on to make more look greate in UI I built a bento grid component with the help of  tailwind classes such as col-span and row-span 
and after that a testimonial and footer component (CTA). To maintain the reusablity I created a constant file which contains the text for paragraphs and testimonials as i can also use in some other sections.

## 📚 What I Learned

Each part of this project helped me understand more about building responsive animated  react apps , managing complex animations , resuablity , responsive designs and improving user experience , learning new things, and improving my skills for future work.
