      "I’ve used many workout trackers over the years and hoops is by far the best. It’s seamless, doesn’t get in your way, and the design is so pleasing to work with. Best of all, the devs are responsive and are quick to address any bugs as they come up!",

    feedback:"Fantastic app not over complicated, have recommended it to individuals of all different training levels and they have found it useful and intuitive. When I thought being able to export data I emailed support who promptly got back to me asking my preferred data type after exporting and notified me this was a feature in the works. Within 2 weeks of the communication the the export feature was live",

    remarks: "Thank you!",
    feedback:"Very refreshing to see a fitness app that keeps workout logging quick and simple. Love the minimalistic design keeping only the essential functions in mind. I think linking an Apple ID should be optional as it’s not a necessity for keeping info on a local device (unless some would prefer a cloud backup). Looks like the app is still in its early days with the workout catalogue, but I’m excited to see where this app goes. Nice work!",
